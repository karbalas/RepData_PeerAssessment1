If the missing data values  \r\nand current frequency of the mean values put to gether is greater than the frequency of the median  \r\nvalue calculated without using median values, it would have stayed the same as before. Since the number  \r\nof missing values increased the frequency of the mean values in the data after filling in the missing  \r\nvalues, the new median is the same as the mean value.\r\n\r\nWhat is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?\r\n* Even though the mean value is NOT impacted by imputing the missing data, median value changed  \r\nto be the same as the mean value due to the number of missing values skewing the frequency of the  \r\nmean values after imputing the missing data.\r\n\r\n## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?\r\nTo address this question, we do the following steps to process the data:  \r\n* Take a copy of the original activity data\r\n* Identify and label weekdays and weekends into a factor of 2 levels: \"weekday\", \"weekend\"\r\n* Compute the average number of steps taken per interval across weekday and weekends using the  \r\nddply function, coputing the mean on the combination of interval and weekday factor level\r\n* Plot the average number of steps taken per interval using factor weekday as the facet\r\n* Display the computed plot\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nrequire(\"plyr\")\r\nrequire(\"ggplot2\")\r\nactivityData <- completeActivityData\r\n#identify if the day is weekday or weekend\r\nactivityData$weekday <- c(\"Weekday\")\r\nactivityData$weekday[weekdays(activityData$date, abbreviate=TRUE) %in% c(\"Sat\",\"Sun\")] <- c(\"Weekend\")\r\n#calculate the average number of steps for the interval across weekdays / weekends\r\nactivityData <- ddply(activityData, \r\n                      c(\"interval\",\"weekday\"), \r\n                      summarise, \r\n                      meanSteps=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))\r\n#plot the data for weekday and weekend in different panels\r\nmyplot <- qplot(interval, meanSteps, data = activityData, col=weekday) + \r\n    facet_wrap( ~ weekday, ncol=1) +\r\n    guides(colour=FALSE) +\r\n    geom_line() +\r\n    labs(title=c(\"Activity patterns between weekday and weekend\"),\r\n         x=\"Interval\", y=\"Number of steps\")\r\n#display the plot\r\nmyplot\r\n```\r\n\r\n![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11](figure/unnamed-chunk-11.png) \r\n\r\nAs can be seen from the plot, the subjects weekend activities starts earlier than that of his/her  \r\nweekday and peaks between 9 and 10am. However, on weekdays the activies start later but stays high  \r\nconsistently across the day unlike the weekends where the activies go down after 10am and stays  \r\nrelatively lower compared to the subjects weekday activity pattern.
